## File Transfer using over TCP Socket using C++

This is a simple C++ project that demonstrates how to transfer a file over a TCP connection between a sender and a receiver. The sender reads a file called tosend.txt and sends its contents over a TCP connection to the receiver, which writes the received data to a file called received.txt.
